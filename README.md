## About the Project

I built this solo project while working through [Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path](https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend). The design in Figma was provided by Scrimba and coded entirely by me.

### Basic requirements for the project:

- Build it from scratch
- Follow the [Figma design](https://scrimba.com/links/figma-we-are-the-champions) (I wasn't a fan of the Freddie Mercury image provided, so I substituted it)
- Firebase Realtime Database
- Update in realtime

### Project stretch goals:

- Add From and To input fields
- Reverse the order so that new items are displayed first
- Add likes
- Make a desktop version (I skipped this step as I am yet to get to the responsive design section of the course)

Total dev time: 4,5 hours

## Tools

The app was built with the help of these tools:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) - a cloud-hosted NoSQL database that lets you store and sync data in realtime
- [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) - create your own color palette, or pick an existing one
- [fonticon](https://gauger.io/fonticon/) - awesome icon generator
